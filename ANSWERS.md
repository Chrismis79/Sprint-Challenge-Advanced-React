- [x] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
    I would use class components over functional components when I need to keep track of some kind of state. 
    Without hooks state can only be managed in class components.

- [x] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
    -componentDidMount- Fires only when a component first renders
    -componentDidUpdate- Fires anytime a component updates (like useEffect)
    -componentDidUnmount- Fires when the component dies and cleans up. 

- [x] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
    -Custom hooks allow you to write a function that holds stateful logic once and reuse it throughout your code. Keeping code DRY and more readable. 

- [x] Why is it important to test our apps?
    -It is important to test apps because it helps us write cleaner, better code. Provides a safety net so someone doesn't come in later and break the code. It allows for easier code maintance as well. Gives you more confidence in your code.
